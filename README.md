__Test Suite Archetype - TestNG Framework__

A Maven archetype that provides a template for creating a new executable 
test suite (ETS) based on the [TestNG framework](http://testng.org/). The 
resulting test project facilitates conformance testing performed in support 
of the [OGC Compliance Program](http://cite.opengeospatial.org/), although 
its applicability is by no means restricted to that program.

Visit the [project documentation website](http://opengeospatial.github.io/ets-archetype-testng/) 
for more information.
